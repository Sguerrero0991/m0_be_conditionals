# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code?
A conditional statement in code is useful whenever you need your program to perform different actions based on whether a specific condition is true or false.

1. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?
I would go over more examples of all types of conditionals and maybe look up a YouTube vide on them. During the exercises and challenges I needed to look back to our lessons various times to find what each conditional did and when best to use it. I'm still figuring it out, it's kind of like math word problems and I've always struggled with those but I think as I keep practicing and seeing more examples of each, I'll understand it all more. 

1. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?
Seeing that I actually know more than I realize. The git workflow is pretty ingrained now which is pretty neat. While I was struggling with the challenges, I knew exactly when to git add, git commit -m, I constantly checked git status, and I knew when to git push origin. So that process at least was very streamlined. I've also learned to slow down and really pay attention to the commands I enter in my terminal to avoid errors which is really important.
